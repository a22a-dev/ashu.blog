<p>Nowadays, where ever I see, fake news is omnipresent. It is in ads, pitch, political campaign, news sites, magazines etc. In short, everywhere. People look upto these sites and magazines to get information about what is happening in society &amp; world. But they are not realizing it, that these sites are just copy pasting anything that they find on internet and publish it, without any verification on their part. I am not saying that all the content are fake, but that is the issue. If all content is fake then it is easy to identify the fake content, but they insert these things into genuine news and hence people just blindly accept it.</p>
<p>Now these fake content in genuine news is not completely fake, they do show the right things, but they nudge it in such a way that it serves their master and people stay ignorant of the fact. I see everyday, on twitter, social media sites, where spend their most of the time of the day, that journalist and other such people, they just retweet anything without even thinking about its consequence or its validity.</p>
<p>Just few days ago, I saw a tweet where somebody posted a photo of newly built public infrastructure and said that it doesn't have a name in bangla, but hindi and english names are present. Moment I saw that photo, I knew it was fake or misleading tweet, but people jumped on the bandwagaon of insulting the government, the party and everybody involved in it. And it turns out that the photo was taken from a specific angle that bangla name was hidden due to the sunlight in background.</p>
<p>All these is amplified due to the fact, today everybody has access to information. And having access to information is not bad in itself. But when people don't think about the facts they are presented with, then the problem arises. I shouldn't say these, but our education system is also to blame. Now you might have understood where I am getting at.</p>
<p>For those who didn't understood, I will explain.</p>
<p>It is simple deduction, students in schools don't pay attention to why teacher is speaking or teaching a specific thing, hell, even if teacher teaches something wrong, they rote memorize it and move on, without questioning it. They just have blind faith on teacher. And why wouldn't they?. Schools in India are remnants of british era, where they wanted people to work under them, without questioning and in factories, where boss is god. You did what your boss said. Boss is always right. Hence to instill this mentality in their worker and subordinates, they taught kids the same way.</p>
<p>These type schooling is still prevalent in large parts of india. Students are encouraged to give up creativity and follow the herd. And also it makes teachers job easier. And these also makes the job of whoever is going to be the boss. People in power don't like to be questioned by people lower in stature. Hence history is evident to these facts, caste system [1] &amp; religion [2] is one big system to keep people in control.</p>
<p>Religion kept people obedient by</p>
<ul>
<li>giving them baseless talks about god and how god is responsible for everything that is happening</li>
<li>making them do things that they won't do by themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, god never existed. God were the people who</p>
