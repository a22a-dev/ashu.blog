        <h1>Book Review - The City We Became</h1>
        <h1>Review</h1>
<p>This book has been a great geographical/political map crash course of NYC and its adjacent area for me. Why? Because it references the parts of city so often that it was difficult to keep track of the story and its meaning and it's concept is so weird in first place.</p>
<p>The concept introduced here is certainly something we dont see everyday. Here the author tries to create an amulgation of a city and humans. Even the fight that happens in early part of book (or say in the Introduction itself) is so crazy or weird that I had a hard time keeping up with the fight. Because i had look up the places or boroughs that primary was using as part of his body and that places describtion that he was using to define why he was using it. And in order to keep up with so many different weird things in track i had to create a character sketch of city and each character, to understand the plot clearly and remember it enough to complete the book.</p>
<p>But it is a great book. It is everything that a best seller fiction should have. I havent even reached halfmark but i know something amazing is waiting for me on the another end. And even better, it is a part of series so i cant even wait to see what it has in store for me.</p>
<h4>Hanger</h4>
<p>They kind of defeated the women in white and at the same time purged the staten island out of newyork spiritually, where the woman in white resides now. The primary is awake, coda is his name i guess. They all are happy now. Veneza is now a city too, Jersey City. Sao Paulo is good to. Hong is back in his city, safe. They are invited to a summit in paris. Elder have accepted them. Sao Paulo has went back to home.</p>
