	<h1>overlord review</h1>
<p>Overlord is based in a MMORPG game. It starts with a scene where game server is being shut down, after popularity of game has declined over the years. And their is a guy who is waiting for it to happen and spending last minute in game, remenising about there time spent in game with his guild mates. One by one all his mates leave the game, thinking game server will be definitely shut down. But as is the case with all the anime, protoganist gets locked into the game and he has no way of getting out. Then begins his journey in game for real...</p>
<p>Overlord is one of the amazing Anime to have come, although it does not hold a candle to my all time favorites Naruto, Attack on Titans etc. It is good in a sense that protagonist is always the antagonist in story. And the way he manipulates people and empires to do his bidding, is just amazing.
Although sometimes it does get a little slow paced at times, but it makes up for it in its plot execution.</p>
<p>My review is still incomplete, because netflix in India, currently, has only 4 seasons. So I will watch remaining seasons from other sources, which I think is going to be difficult since kissanime is shut down. But I will definitely watch them all.</p>
<p>Today, I started watching Orange is the New Black. And I am enjoying watching it.</p>
<p>Next time I will post review of it too.</p>
