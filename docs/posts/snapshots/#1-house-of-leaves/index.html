        <h1>House of Leaves - #1</h1>
        <p>It starts with a guy talking about his nightmare and how he has tried all kinds of drugs to get rid of it, but could'nt. He talks about he got to this point. He has a friend named lude, who lives in a building where a oldman named zampano stayed. Building has a manager named Flaze, he is samaon. He talks about he regrets answering the phone call form his friend lude, that fateful night. And talks about what happened that night. What they found at old man's place. FYI, old man is dead. They give away the oldman's things, since he had no relatives and family. The guy takes the some papers in which oldman had written some things. And guy reads it whenever he got the time to do it.</p>
<p>But then starts to get paranoid, stops going anywhere. Time passes for him, without even realizing it. After reading those papers he found out that oldman was talking about some Documentary which never existed in the firstplace. Then he talks about some philosophical things, where it starts to get a bit boring.</p>
<p>Book is a little bit slow in pace for now. Who knows, it might pick up the pace. But it is a horror book for sure. Lets how it goes. I have read about 5% of the book.</p>
