<p>It is one of the few TV series which I really like to watch and can't wait for new episodes to come. And it has good accents. I love british shows for this reason itself.</p>
<p>There have been really few TV series that I can say this about.</p>
<p>It is comedy series, but also very inspirational at the same time.</p>
<p>Also it feels really great to watch people achieve things in life, it makes you wanna do great things too. And what better would a series be that uses game to do so. I remember watching Chak De India and other movies over and over just so I could relive the moment with them.</p>
<p>Ted himself is quite a good character to look at. He is funny, witty, open minded and has very different perspective on life. But also has his inner demons.</p>
<p>And now only thing that we can do is to wait for season three to arrive.</p>
